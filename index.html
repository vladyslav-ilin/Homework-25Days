					<span>T</span>his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a
					troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its
					speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes
					marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
					bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
					moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.
				</p>
				<p class="font__text">
					The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most
					reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please
					the buffaloes to get out of the way. <br>
					Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers
					upon them.
				</p>
				<p class="font__text">
					&#34;What a country!&#34; cried he.&#34;Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as
					if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
					programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!&#34;
